Postdoc Fellowship - Nanotechnology Research Network,Sponsor: Jimma University,"Engineering, Chemistry, Physics, Science and Technology","25,000","Nanotechnology Research Network is a project organized by the National Institute of Arts & Sciences and American Nano Society for activating research groups in different universities and connect them through joint projects. An active group is located in Department of Materials Science & Engineering at Jimma University, Ethiopia. The group is chaired by Professor Ali Eftekhari, President of the American Nano Society. 

We have a unique strategy in leading the team. Thus, please carefully read the job description before applying. 


* This is part of a chair system in which assistant/associate professors work under supervision of a chair, and you will be officially appointed as an assistant or associate professor. This is indeed equivalent to the modern postdoc model in the United States and other countries. 

* You will work in a team of 15 - 20 postdoc fellows coming from different countries. 

* Due to the team structure, flexibility to be supervised is one of the main criteria. 

* Contrary to many postdoc fellowships, the present position is not focused on a specific research project. Instead, the postdoc fellows are involved in different tasks from research to academic affairs. The main theme is to empower the team members with various academic skills. 

* The postdoc fellows should necessarily start to work on a new research topic (different from their past experiences), and normally involved in literature review during the first six months. The goal is to publish review article or book. 

* The department is quite young, and you are part of the team developing the department. While initiatives have potential opportunities and excellent experiences for academic career, everything is not perfect. 

* We are looking for people who are ambitious and want to take this step as a jump in his/her academic career (e.g., appointment at top universities). There is no room for people who are interested in routine jobs for today. 

* A significant part of this position is teaching duties. 

* Each member should be committed to the team promotion internationally. Skills for networking are critically important. 

* The salary is about $24,000 - $30,000, which is quite high considering the cost of living (i.e. four times higher than local full professors). Housing and flights will be covered. On the other hand, we are looking for those who are interested in the potentials of this position rather than a routine job with high salary. 

* Jimma city is probably different from your imagination about Africa. The nature is greener than Europe, and the weather is always at excellent condition (18 - 25 C).

Master in International Security Studies (MISS),"Sponsor: Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague","Public Administration, History, Liberal Arts/Humanities, Political Science and Geography",Not available,"Master in International Security Studies (MISS) is a two-year English-language Master's degree program, which offers students a complex guide through security, conflict and strategic studies in the context of international relations. It is taught at prestigious Charles University in Prague, the oldest and the largest university in Prague.

MISS promotes a progressive approach to teaching which, among other things, includes reducing class sizes and an emphasis on seminars.  The pedagogical instructors aim to conduct their classes through presentations, discussions or simulations incorporating students, rather than through a one-sided monologue of facts which can be acquired by other means.  This logically requires thorough preparation on the part of the student outside the class through extensive reading of the course texts.  The main goal of this is to streamline the teaching process through actively involving the students in class and making it possible for them to present their opinions on and understandings of the material.

Graduates of the program are prepared to pursue careers in security-related posts in government offices and public administration, international organizations, NGOs and transnational corporations.

Requirements:
The Master in International Security Studies is open only to students who have already completed (or are about to complete) a Bachelor's degree.
English-language ability. It is assumed that applicants will have a sufficient knowledge of English to attend classes and write papers in English. Although we welcome TOEFL and IELTS, they are not necessarily a condition of entry. A real ability to study in English is more important.

Tuition fees for the Master in International Security Studies program are set at 3,000 Euro per semester, payable at the start of each semester. 
Thanks to a generous contribution from the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, the Faculty of Social Sciences is able to offer a limited number of partial scholarships for students of the English-taught programs. The scholarships are earmarked for students from developing countries and/or countries going through a process of political and economic transition."

TUMS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS,Sponsor: Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS),Other,Variable,"Introduction:
 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is recognized throughout the world, with around 2.5 million affected individuals. Although the disease was recognized in the 19th century, there were limited data on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of MS until the last 50 years. With every step of progress in immunology, imaging and biotechnology, there was indeed progress in our understanding of etiology and diagnosis of this potentially disabling disease. Even with such an amazing progress in technology, the exact etiology and absolute cure for MS is not known yet, thus MS has been the focus of interest in clinical and basic science research in the past decades. Hundreds of MS research groups, centers and clinics are performing research on this field from animal studies to human clinical trials. Due to their interests and efforts, MS has become a partially treatable disease with introduction of the drugs that are able to reduce annual relapse rates and delayed disability.
 
MS management starts with diagnosis and continues with strategies to control relapses, increasing quality of life of the patients, symptomatic treatments and rehabilitation. With our progress in this field, management of different patients has become more complicated and in some cases needs special training. These facts led the pioneer MS research centers around the world to start special MS training programs for neurologists for better management and addressing the ever-growing issues about understanding, diagnosis and treatment of multiple sclerosis.  The moderate to high prevalence of MS in Iran (20-50 in 100,000) has led the local neurologist to pay special attention to patient management and research. Tehran University of Medical Sciences, as the leading medical university in Iran provides  18 months of advanced training in diagnosis, treatment and clinical research in Multiple Sclerosis. This Fellowship program is conducted under the supervision of neurologists specialized in MS in Tehran University of Medical sciences and invited authorities from other countries."

Dissertation Fellowships from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation,Sponsor: Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation,Unrestricted,"$20,000","In addition to the foundation’s program of support for postdoctoral research, ten or more
dissertation fellowships are awarded each year to graduate students who would complete the writing of
a dissertation within the award year. These fellowships, in the amount of $20,000, are intended to
contribute to the support of the doctoral candidate to enable him or her to complete the thesis in a
timely manner and are only appropriate for students approaching the final year of their Ph.D. work.
This fellowship is not for support of doctoral research. Applications are evaluated in comparison with each
other and not in competition with proposals for our research grant. Applicants may be citizens of any
country and studying at colleges or universities in any country.
Questions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change,
intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects. Dissertations
with no relevance to understanding human violence and aggression will not be supported. Priority will
also be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other
funding sources.
Eligibility
These grants are made to Ph.D. candidates who are entering the dissertation stage of graduate
school. Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and writing has begun. If
analysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be confident of completing the
dissertation within the year, he or she should not apply, as the application will probably not be
competitive with those that comply with this timetable. In some disciplines, particularly experimental
fields, research and writing can reasonably be expected to be completed within the same year, and in
those cases it is appropriate to apply.
Timing
Applications for dissertation fellowships must be submitted by February 1. Applications are
reviewed during the spring, with final decisions made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in June.
Applicants will be informed promptly by email as well as letter of the Board's decision. Awards
ordinarily commence on September 1, but other starting dates (after July 1) may be requested if the
nature of the project makes this appropriate.
Taxation
A recipient of a dissertation fellowship may be liable for income taxes on funds awarded, depending
on whether the funds are used to pay tuition and certain other related expenses, the amount of the
recipient's other income, the law of the recipient's domicile, and other factors. The foundation does
not provide advice on tax matters. Applicants should consult their own tax advisors to determine the
tax consequences of receiving a dissertation fellowship.
Final Report
Recipients of the dissertation fellowship must submit a copy of the dissertation, approved and
accepted by their institution, within six months after the end of the award year. Any papers, books,
articles, or other publications based on the research should also be sent to the foundation."

Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation Dissertation Fellowship,Sponsor: Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation,Unrestricted,"$20,000 USD","In addition to the foundation’s program of support for postdoctoral research, ten or more
dissertation fellowships are awarded each year to graduate students who would complete the writing of
a dissertation within the award year. These fellowships, in the amount of $20,000, are intended to
contribute to the support of the doctoral candidate to enable him or her to complete the thesis in a
timely manner and are only appropriate for students approaching the final year of their Ph.D. work.
This fellowship is not for support of doctoral research. Applications are evaluated in comparison with each
other and not in competition with proposals for our research grant. Applicants may be citizens of any
country and studying at colleges or universities in any country.
Questions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change,
intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects. Dissertations
with no relevance to understanding human violence and aggression will not be supported. Priority will
also be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other
funding sources.
Eligibility
These grants are made to Ph.D. candidates who are entering the dissertation stage of graduate
school. Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and writing has begun. If
analysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be confident of completing the
dissertation within the year, he or she should not apply, as the application will probably not be
competitive with those that comply with this timetable. In some disciplines, particularly experimental
fields, research and writing can reasonably be expected to be completed within the same year, and in
those cases it is appropriate to apply.
Timing
Applications for dissertation fellowships must be submitted by February 1. Applications are
reviewed during the spring, with final decisions made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in June.
Applicants will be informed promptly by email as well as letter of the Board's decision. Awards
ordinarily commence on September 1, but other starting dates (after July 1) may be requested if the

Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation Research Grants,Sponsor: Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation,Unrestricted,"$15,000 - $40,000 USD","The foundation welcomes proposals from any of the natural and social sciences and the humanities that promise to increase understanding of the causes, manifestations, and control of violence and aggression. Highest priority is given to research that can increase understanding and amelioration of urgent problems of violence and aggression in the modern world.

Questions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change, intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects. Research with no relevance to understanding human problems will not be supported, nor will proposals to investigate urgent social problems where the foundation cannot be assured that useful, sound research can be done. Priority will also be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other funding sources.

The Research Grant

Most awards fall within the range of $15,000 to $40,000 per year for periods of one or two years. Applications for larger amounts and longer durations must be very strongly justified. The foundation awards research grants to individuals (or a few principal investigators at most) for individual projects and does not award grants to institutions for institutional programs. Individuals who receive research grants may be subject to taxation on the funds awarded.Final decisions are made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in December. Applicants will be informed promptly by email as well as letter of the Board's decision. Grants ordinarily commence on January 1 but later starting dates may be requested if the nature of the research makes this appropriate.

Education and Citizenship

Applicants for a research grant may be citizens of any country. While almost all recipients of our research grant possess a Ph.D., M.D., or equivalent degree, there are no formal degree requirements for the grant. The grant, however, may not be used to support research undertaken as part of the requirements for a graduate degree. Applicants need not be affiliated with an institution of higher learning, although most are college or university professors.

Application

Applications are submitted online. The online application will be available beginning April 1st. Applicants will first create a login account and will then be able to access detailed guidelines and the online application."

Postdoc Fellowship - Nanotechnology Research Network,Sponsor: Jimma University,"Engineering, Chemistry, Physics, Science and Technology","25,000","Nanotechnology Research Network is a project organized by the National Institute of Arts & Sciences and American Nano Society for activating research groups in different universities and connect them through joint projects. An active group is located in Department of Materials Science & Engineering at Jimma University, Ethiopia. The group is chaired by Professor Ali Eftekhari, President of the American Nano Society. 

We have a unique strategy in leading the team. Thus, please carefully read the job description before applying. 


* This is part of a chair system in which assistant/associate professors work under supervision of a chair, and you will be officially appointed as an assistant or associate professor. This is indeed equivalent to the modern postdoc model in the United States and other countries. 

* You will work in a team of 15 - 20 postdoc fellows coming from different countries. 

* Due to the team structure, flexibility to be supervised is one of the main criteria. 

* Contrary to many postdoc fellowships, the present position is not focused on a specific research project. Instead, the postdoc fellows are involved in different tasks from research to academic affairs. The main theme is to empower the team members with various academic skills. 

* The postdoc fellows should necessarily start to work on a new research topic (different from their past experiences), and normally involved in literature review during the first six months. The goal is to publish review article or book. 

* The department is quite young, and you are part of the team developing the department. While initiatives have potential opportunities and excellent experiences for academic career, everything is not perfect. 

* We are looking for people who are ambitious and want to take this step as a jump in his/her academic career (e.g., appointment at top universities). There is no room for people who are interested in routine jobs for today. 

* A significant part of this position is teaching duties. 

* Each member should be committed to the team promotion internationally. Skills for networking are critically important. 

* The salary is about $24,000 - $30,000, which is quite high considering the cost of living (i.e. four times higher than local full professors). Housing and flights will be covered. On the other hand, we are looking for those who are interested in the potentials of this position rather than a routine job with high salary. 

* Jimma city is probably different from your imagination about Africa. The nature is greener than Europe, and the weather is always at excellent condition (18 - 25 C).

Master in International Security Studies (MISS),"Sponsor: Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague","Public Administration, History, Liberal Arts/Humanities, Political Science and Geography",Not available,"Master in International Security Studies (MISS) is a two-year English-language Master's degree program, which offers students a complex guide through security, conflict and strategic studies in the context of international relations. It is taught at prestigious Charles University in Prague, the oldest and the largest university in Prague.

MISS promotes a progressive approach to teaching which, among other things, includes reducing class sizes and an emphasis on seminars.  The pedagogical instructors aim to conduct their classes through presentations, discussions or simulations incorporating students, rather than through a one-sided monologue of facts which can be acquired by other means.  This logically requires thorough preparation on the part of the student outside the class through extensive reading of the course texts.  The main goal of this is to streamline the teaching process through actively involving the students in class and making it possible for them to present their opinions on and understandings of the material.

Graduates of the program are prepared to pursue careers in security-related posts in government offices and public administration, international organizations, NGOs and transnational corporations.

The Department was approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), and in 1990 the School of Rehabilitation started to function as the School of Rehabilitation.
The first four years of academic programs of the School were just limited to Physiotherapy. Later, other fields of Rehabilitation, such as Audiology, Occupational Therapy, and Speech Therapy were added to the program.
During the 8-year imposed war (the 1st Persian Gulf War), there was a unique opportunity to face with various kinds of patients who needed rehabilitation services; therefore, there was an emergency need for preparing the relevant therapists. From that time, the School has led the way in preparing students with the knowledge, behavior, and skills required to function within the diverse roles of the contemporary health care environment.

Secondary School Exchange Scholarship,Sponsor: ESU,Unrestricted,"$30,000 - $50,000","Since 1928, the ESU has offered thousands of young people the once in a lifetime opportunity to spend two or three terms in a private US high school, after A-levels. A Secondary School Exchange Scholarship is a gap year with a difference. Scholars study a range of subjects including some that don’t feature in a British school syllabus. Many scholars take the opportunity to study subjects they dropped at GCSE, or to go into more depth in their chosen degree subject, without the added pressure of A-levels. The study skills that can be gained from the exchange have proven to be beneficial at University: American teaching emphasises independence of thought, and discussions play a large part in the classroom.

SSE is also as much a cultural exchange as an academic one. Host schools offer an extensive range of extracurricular activities and facilities, as well as American rites of passage such as spring break, prom, and graduation. Your independence, wider outlook and increased maturity will be of benefit to you at university and in your future career."

Secondary School Exchange Scholarship,Sponsor: ESU,Unrestricted,"$30,000 - $50,000","Since 1928, the ESU has offered thousands of young people the once in a lifetime opportunity to spend two or three terms in a private US high school, after A-levels. A Secondary School Exchange Scholarship is a gap year with a difference. Scholars study a range of subjects including some that don’t feature in a British school syllabus. Many scholars take the opportunity to study subjects they dropped at GCSE, or to go into more depth in their chosen degree subject, without the added pressure of A-levels. The study skills that can be gained from the exchange have proven to be beneficial at University: American teaching emphasises independence of thought, and discussions play a large part in the classroom.

SSE is also as much a cultural exchange as an academic one. Host schools offer an extensive range of extracurricular activities and facilities, as well as American rites of passage such as spring break, prom, and graduation. Your independence, wider outlook and increased maturity will be of benefit to you at university and in your future career."

TUMS Multiple Sclerosis Fellowship,Sponsor: Tehran University of Medical Sciences,Unrestricted,0,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that usually affects young and middle-aged adults and causes a considerable social and economic burden. During recent years MS has become one of the most common reasons for admissions to a neurological ward. Now MS is recognized throughout the world, with around 2.5 million affected individuals. Although the disease was recognized in the 19th century, there were limited data on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of MS for the last 50 years. With every step of progress in immunology, imaging and biotechnology, there was indeed progress in our understanding of etiology and diagnosis of this potentially disabling disease. Even with such an amazing progress in technology, the exact etiology and absolute cure for MS is not known yet; thus, MS has been the focus of interest in clinical and basic science research in the past decades. Hundreds of MS research groups, centers and clinics are conducting research on this field ranging from animal studies to human clinical trials. Due to their interests and efforts, MS has become a partially treatable disease with the introduction of the drugs that are able to reduce annual relapse rates and delay disability.
 
MS management starts with diagnosis and continues with strategies to control relapses, increasing quality of life of the patients, symptomatic treatments and rehabilitation. With our progress in this field, management of different patients has become more complicated and in some cases needs special training. These facts led the pioneer MS research centers around the world to start special MS training programs for neurologists for better management and addressing of the ever-growing issues about understanding, diagnosis and treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.  The moderate to high prevalence of MS in Iran (20-50 in 100,000) has led the local neurologist to pay special attention to patient management and research. Tehran University of Medical Sciences, as the leading medical university in Iran provides 18 months of advanced training in diagnosis, treatment and clinical research in Multiple Sclerosis. This Fellowship program is conducted under the supervision of neurologists specialized in MS atTehran University of Medical Sciences and the invited authorities from other countries."

PhD Position in HPC - Multilevel Scheduling,Sponsor: University of Basel,"Computer & Information Systems, Engineering and Computer Animation",100% employment,"The need for large-scale computations or for supporting large data-intensive calculations leads to the use of multiple (clusters of) parallel computers at different sites distributed across the Internet. The computational grid and cloud are examples of such distributed (possibly heterogeneous) computing systems and offer multiple hierarchical levels of parallelism: site, cluster, node, socket, core, vector, pipeline, and instruction1. Each level of parallelism requires at least a scheduler. For instance, at the cluster level there are batch schedulers and runtime systems. Depending on the level of parallelism, schedulers can be viewed as global and local. From a site level parallelism perspective, global schedulers distribute the computational tasks or the communication among the different sites, whereas local schedulers distribute the tasks or the communication among the computational nodes of a particular site. Furthermore, from the cluster level parallelism perspective, decisions made by the runtime system regarding the initial placement of application tasks to locally assigned computing resources can significantly influence the outcome of a cluster level scheduler. The scheduling goals differ from level to level and may be conflicting between levels. For instance, cluster level schedulers typically aim at maximizing fairness among all applications in terms of their execution time which may result in non-optimal execution times for certain applications. Application level schedulers typically aim at minimizing the execution time of a single application, which may result in non-balanced execution times among applications. Addressing the problem jointly at multiple levels is called multi-level scheduling and constitutes a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem."
PhD Position in HPC - Robust Scheduling,Sponsor: University of Basel,"Communications, Computer & Information Systems, Engineering and Computer Animation",100% employment,"High performance computing systems consume and dissipate a great amount of power. Excessive heat dissipation requires aggressive cooling and extra space that adds to the power consumption and infrastructure cost. Moreover, as the sizes of the system as well as the system temperature rapidly increase, high system failure rates are observed. Thus, a feature of interest for scheduling scientific applications in such environments is support for fault detection and management. This characterizes the quality aspect of the time-to-solution. 
A solution to the application-level resilience to faults problem must meet the following requirements: (i) Efficiency, without compromising performance; (ii) The reliability level must be user controlled – greater reliability incurs a higher cost (either in terms of resources, CPU time, energy consumption, or allocation price); and (iii) Minimal code changes in the application. Scheduling algorithms that detect faults and are able to manage them are called fault tolerant (or resilient to faults). The most common fault tolerance strategies include task replication (via double or triple modular redundancy) and application checkpointing. However, it is unclear which of the existing solutions will scale to the size of the exascale computing systems expected by the beginning of the next decade."

The Scholarship Selection Committee of PGSF will determine the amount of each scholarship. The amount of the scholarship is not made public. The award will be paid in a lump sum directly to the college financial aid office, in the student’s name. The college will be authorized to draw upon the grant for payment of tuition and other fees.

Scholarship Renewal
A scholarship is awarded for up to four years of college (unless otherwise specified) provided the scholarship recipient maintains a high scholastic average and continues in an approved program of study. The student’s record is reviewed at the end of each grading period and, if satisfactory, the award is extended for the following year. Students are required to maintain a cumulative “B” (3.0) average. If a student’s grades fall below this cumulative average, the student will be put on academic probation and the funds withheld until the grades are raised. If the student does not raise the grades during the same academic year, the student loses the scholarship and must reapply."

Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation Dissertation Fellowship,Sponsor: Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation,Unrestricted,"$20,000 USD","In addition to the foundation’s program of support for postdoctoral research, ten or more
dissertation fellowships are awarded each year to graduate students who would complete the writing of
a dissertation within the award year. These fellowships, in the amount of $20,000, are intended to
contribute to the support of the doctoral candidate to enable him or her to complete the thesis in a
timely manner and are only appropriate for students approaching the final year of their Ph.D. work.
This fellowship is not for support of doctoral research. Applications are evaluated in comparison with each
other and not in competition with proposals for our research grant. Applicants may be citizens of any
country and studying at colleges or universities in any country.
Questions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change,
intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects. Dissertations
with no relevance to understanding human violence and aggression will not be supported. Priority will
also be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other
funding sources.
Eligibility
These grants are made to Ph.D. candidates who are entering the dissertation stage of graduate
school. Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and writing has begun. If
analysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be confident of completing the
dissertation within the year, he or she should not apply, as the application will probably not be
competitive with those that comply with this timetable. In some disciplines, particularly experimental
fields, research and writing can reasonably be expected to be completed within the same year, and in
those cases it is appropriate to apply.
Timing
Applications for dissertation fellowships must be submitted by February 1. Applications are
reviewed during the spring, with final decisions made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in June.
Applicants will be informed promptly by email as well as letter of the Board's decision. Awards
ordinarily commence on September 1, but other starting dates (after July 1) may be requested if the
nature of the project makes this appropriate."
Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation Research Grants,Sponsor: Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation,Unrestricted,"$15,000 - $40,000 USD","The foundation welcomes proposals from any of the natural and social sciences and the humanities that promise to increase understanding of the causes, manifestations, and control of violence and aggression. Highest priority is given to research that can increase understanding and amelioration of urgent problems of violence and aggression in the modern world.

Questions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change, intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects. Research with no relevance to understanding human problems will not be supported, nor will proposals to investigate urgent social problems where the foundation cannot be assured that useful, sound research can be done. Priority will also be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other funding sources.

The Research Grant

Most awards fall within the range of $15,000 to $40,000 per year for periods of one or two years. Applications for larger amounts and longer durations must be very strongly justified. The foundation awards research grants to individuals (or a few principal investigators at most) for individual projects and does not award grants to institutions for institutional programs.

The 2016 edition’s topic will be The Challenges of Urbanisation. 

Managing urban growth has become one of the most important challenges of the 21stcentury. In the world today, what kind of urbanisation will nurture sustainable growth and development? As the key to this challenge is an interdisciplinary solution, crossing traditional boundaries between academic disciplines, we are inviting graduate students from all academic programmes to provide helpful strategic recommendations. The idea is to gather contributions that are both theoretically grounded and offer pragmatic solutions to a relevant international development problem stemming from an interdisciplinary collaboration between 3 to 5 enrolled master students from anywhere in the world. 

Identify a challenge stemming from urbanization;  

Construct an interdisciplinary analysis on how it affects different aspects of development in a specific (but transposable) context; 

Propose innovation at the policy, practice, process or technology levels turning the challenge into development opportunity. The finalists will be invited to publically present their work in Geneva before a panel of highlevel experts. Networking and publication opportunities are also envisioned as part of the prize package."
RESEARCH GRANT - BIM/Nº52 - 29-04-2016 - CRACKIT,Sponsor: Instituto de Telecomunicações,Engineering and Applied Science,980€,"These research positions focuses on the research and development of a system able to process images of the surface of flexible road pavements, to allow for the automatic detection and characterization of road surface defects. Although cracks with linear development are considered the most common pavement surface degradation found by road inspectors, other important surface defects like cracks with alligator pattern, potholes, routing, raveling, among others, represent important data about pavement surface condition to allow for an adequate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of road pavement surface degradation. Images of road surface taken using imaging systems composed of one regular camera (considered as been non-expensive imaging systems) have been used by researchers, mainly on the detection of cracks with linear development. However, these images are 2D data structures, been difficult to detect defects like potholes, routing or raveling when processing them, because the depth information along a profile of the road defect is missing. Light-field cameras, capturing light ray directions, have recently become available. The processing of the richer light field images allows a more complete analysis of the road pavement surface, for instance supporting depth estimation. An alternative/complementary sensor that can be used for road surface defect detection is a mobile Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). From this type of sensor a 3D point cloud, representing the transversal profiles of a road lane, can be created for the desired analysis. This project exploits the usage of these two types of imaging sensors.

TUMS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS,Sponsor: Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS),Other,Variable,"Introduction:
 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is recognized throughout the world, with around 2.5 million affected individuals. Although the disease was recognized in the 19th century, there were limited data on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of MS until the last 50 years. With every step of progress in immunology, imaging and biotechnology, there was indeed progress in our understanding of etiology and diagnosis of this potentially disabling disease. Even with such an amazing progress in technology, the exact etiology and absolute cure for MS is not known yet, thus MS has been the focus of interest in clinical and basic science research in the past decades. Hundreds of MS research groups, centers and clinics are performing research on this field from animal studies to human clinical trials. Due to their interests and efforts, MS has become a partially treatable disease with introduction of the drugs that are able to reduce annual relapse rates and delayed disability.
 
MS management starts with diagnosis and continues with strategies to control relapses, increasing quality of life of the patients, symptomatic treatments and rehabilitation. With our progress in this field, management of different patients has become more complicated and in some cases needs special training. These facts led the pioneer MS research centers around the world to start special MS training programs for neurologists for better management and addressing the ever-growing issues about understanding, diagnosis and treatment of multiple sclerosis.  The moderate to high prevalence of MS in Iran (20-50 in 100,000) has led the local neurologist to pay special attention to patient management and research. Tehran University of Medical Sciences, as the leading medical university in Iran provides  18 months of advanced training in diagnosis, treatment and clinical research in Multiple Sclerosis. This Fellowship program is conducted under the supervision of neurologists specialized in MS in Tehran University of Medical sciences and invited authorities from other countries."
